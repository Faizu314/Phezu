Hello, these are all of my packages that I use in my Unity projects. Feel free to take anything you need.

To install a package use the add via git url option in the package manager.

Here is the link:
https://github.com/Faizu314/Phezu.git?path=/PACKAGEPATH
 
Example: https://github.com/Faizu314/Phezu.git?path=/Assets/com.phezu.util

Note: Make sure to install all dependencies of a package before installing it, you will find the dependencies in the .json file of a package. Package manager does not resolve the dependencies of packages installed via git url. Also, make sure that git is installed and your environment variable is set to be able to add packages via git url.
